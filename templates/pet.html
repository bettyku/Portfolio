    			<p>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a very intelligent herding breed. As such, Pembrokes typically need a job to do to keep them busy and out of trouble, but are not on the go 24 hours a day like some other herding breeds. They are extremely quick to learn, but unlike some breeds like Golden Retrievers, arenâ€™t necessarily willing to please for praise. Food and toy rewards are great motivators while negative reinforcement will cause a Pembroke to shut down. They excel in agility, flyball, and herding, but are not known for doing as well in the very formal competition obedience ring.</p>
