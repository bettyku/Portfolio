    			<p>If my legs had an attached meter measuring movement through lifetime, it would register far more revolutions than steps. In fact I hardly ever walk anywhere unless I have to â€“ from my office chair to get coffee, to climb stairs, visit the bathroom, enter a pub, or go to a meeting. I'd probably cycle to those too if permitted, and if it wasn't slightly dangerous.</p>
